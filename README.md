One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is
wearable computing - see for example this
[article](http://www.insideactivitytracking.com/data-science-activity-tracking-and-the-battle-for-the-worlds-top-sports-brand/)
. Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the
most advanced algorithms to attract new users. The data linked to from
the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from
the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the
site where the data was obtained:

Here are the data for the project:

This is file explains how all of the scripts work and how they are
connected. For processing the data the following steps have to be done:

-   download and unzip the data for the project in a working directory

-   run the script **run\_analysis.R** in RStudio

-   You will find an output-file **data\_tidy.txt**. This file contains
    measurements on the mean and standard deviation for
    each measurement. The data are summarized with the average of each
    variable for each activity and each subject.
